<h1Traffic Sign Recognizer>

This deep learning model utilizes Tensorflow to recognize traffic signs which could be used to deploy in self driving cars.

APPENDIX


In this case study, we want to classify images of traffic signs using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The dataset consists of 43 different classes of images.
Classes are as listed below:
0 = Speed limit (20km/h)
1 = Speed limit (30km/h)
2 = Speed limit (50km/h)
3 = Speed limit (60km/h)
4 = Speed limit (70km/h)
5 = Speed limit (80km/h)
6 = End of speed limit (80km/h)
7 = Speed limit (100km/h)
8 = Speed limit (120km/h)
9 = No passing
10 = No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons
11 = Right-of-way at the next intersection
12 = Priority road
13 = Yield
14 = Stop
15 = No vehicles
16 = Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited
17 = No entry
18 = General caution
19 = Dangerous curve to the left
20 = Dangerous curve to the right
21 = Double curve
22 = Bumpy road
23 = Slippery road
24 = Road narrows on the right
25 = Road work
26 = Traffic signals
27 = Pedestrians
28 = Children crossing
29 = Bicycles crossing
30 = Beware of ice/snow
31 = Wild animals crossing
32 = End of all speed and passing limits
33 = Turn right ahead
34 = Turn left ahead
35 = Ahead only
36 = Go straight or right
37 = Go straight or left
38 = Keep right
39 = Keep left
40 = Roundabout mandatory
41 = End of no passing
42 = End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons
